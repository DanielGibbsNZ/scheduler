# Scheduler of people
Smart &amp; easy scheduling for music teams and/or people within a church setting.

Still in its early stages as I work out if "it's a thing" or not.

Born from having to schedule rosters for everyone in the music team at our church. There *has* to be a better (faster!) way!

Currently I'm working on the scheduling algorithm. If it works out to not suck, I'll probably put an Ionic2 UI over the top.

TODO:
- Tests to flesh out the scheduler logic
- [Scheduler](SCHEDULER.md) notes
